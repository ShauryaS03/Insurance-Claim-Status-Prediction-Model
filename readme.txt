# Insurance Claim Status Prediction Model

## Project Overview
The Insurance Claim Status Prediction Model is a machine learning-based solution designed to predict the status of insurance claims. The model helps insurance companies and claimants determine whether a claim is likely to be approved, denied, or requires further review based on historical data and key claim features.

## Features
- Predicts the status of insurance claims based on historical data.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms for improved accuracy.
- Provides insights into factors affecting claim approval.
- Helps insurers optimize claim processing and fraud detection.
- User-friendly interface for easy input and output interpretation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Flask/Django (for web interface, if applicable)
- Jupyter Notebook (for model development and experimentation)


## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing historical insurance claims with features such as:
- Policyholder details (age, income, claim history)
- Claim amount
- Type of insurance
- Claim submission and approval times
- Other relevant features


## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC Score

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate deep learning techniques for better accuracy.
- Expand dataset for better generalization.
- Improve explainability with SHAP values.
- Develop a mobile-friendly interface.
